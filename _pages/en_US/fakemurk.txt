## Prerequisites

- A 8gb or larger USB drive for recovery

## Section I - Enabling Developer Mode

In order to install fakemurk, we need to be in developer mode. Thankfully, it's no longer blocked on your device, so it'll only take 6 minutes (give or take a bit).

Press and hold `Esc+Refresh+Power` for one second, then release it. At the recovery screen, press `Ctrl+D` and then `Enter`. If at any point in the following process, you see a scary "OS Verification is Off" screen, press Ctrl+D. Upon rebooting, you'll have to wait through a long loading screen (you can see a countdown in the top left) and your device will reboot. Be sure to be quick when pressing `Ctrl+D` at the following screen, as after 15 seconds a loud noise will play.

Now, set up your Chromebook normally again and sign in with your personal account. Once signed in, update your Chromebook as far as it will go and reboot your device.

## Section II - Flashing a Recovery Image

Just in case something messes up (which is semi-common with fakemurk), we'll need a recovery image. Find a recovery image for v105 (make sure the board is correct) on one of the following sites:

- [chrome100](https://chrome100.dev/)
- [chrome81](https://rainestorme.github.io/chrome81/)
- [cros.tech](https://cros.tech/)

Once again, the instructions per-platform to flash the image are as follows:

### On *nix

Good choice of operating system, by the way. Most distros will come with the `dd` utility built-in. If yours doesn't, then choose a different distro or find a way to flash the recovery image. Run the following command, making sure that you have the correct /dev path to your USB drive and the correct path to your recovery image:

```sh
dd if=/path/to/recovery-image.bin of=/dev/sdX
```

In a few minutes, you should be done, and the command should exit with a 0 exit code.

### On Windows

Download [Rufus](https://rufus.ie/) and run the executable. Select the .bin file you just downloaded and select your USB drive. Click on flash and follow the prompts. If asked, select "Flash in DD mode".

### On MacOS

Download [Etcher](https://www.balena.io/etcher) and run the excutable. Select the .bin file and your USB drive. Click on flash and follow the prompts.

Set this recovery USB drive aside for later. You're probably gonna need it.

## Section II - Fakemurking

Once logged in, press `Ctrl+Alt+T` to open crosh again. At the prompt, run the following commands:

```sh
shell
sudo su
bash <(curl -SLk https://github.com/MercuryWorkshop/fakemurk/releases/latest/download/fakemurk.sh)
```

## Section III - Recovery (if needed)

If you fakemurked and saw an error of **any kind**, then you'll need to recover and retry. Press `Esc+Refresh+Power` for a second, and plug in your recovery drive. Wait for recovery to finish, then run the above steps again.

## Section IV - Fixing Enrollment Certificate Errors

Once your device reboots (make sure to press `Ctrl+D` at boot) there's a good chance that you'll be stuck at an enrollment screen for a while, then it'll complain about a missing certificate. Don't worry, this is normal!

Just press `Refresh+Power`. **Don't press `Ctrl+D` at this point!** Instead, press `Space` and `Enter` to **disable developer mode**, then, once the screen turns black, **immediately press `Refresh+Power`**.

This will result in a "ChromeOS is missing or damaged" screen. This is also normal. Just press `Esc+Refresh+Power` and enable developer mode again (`Ctrl+D` then `Enter`), then press `Ctrl+D` at boot.

After a short(er) wait, you should be able to enroll.

## Section V - Next Steps

I highly reccomend that you install murkmod, which allows for plugins to be installed to a fakemurked device. Just continue to [Installing Murkmod](murkmod)
{: .notice--success}

Or, you can skip murkmod and continue to [Finalizing Setup](finalizing-setup)
{: .notice--primary}
