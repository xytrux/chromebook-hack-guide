title: "Lilac (Device Policy Editing)"

{% include toc title="Table of Contents" %}

## Prerequisites

- A linux box running Ubuntu - generally, you can use Gitpod to build lilac, but you could also run these instructions on a local Linux box. For a URL that's already set up, see [here](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/MercuryWorkshop/lilac)

## Section I - Install Dependencies

Run the following command:

```sh
sudo apt install protobuf-compiler
```

If you're not building lilac on gitpod, then run the following commands:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/MercuryWorkshop/lilac.git
cd lilac
```

## Section II - Build Boringssl

Run the following commands:

```sh
cd boringssl
mkdir -p build
cd build
cmake -DCMAKE_POSITION_INDEPENDENT_CODE=TRUE ..
make
make install DESTDIR=../install
cd ../../
```

## Section III - Build the Protocol Buffers

Run the following command:

```sh
protoc -I proto proto/* --cpp_out=.
```

## Section IV - Compile Lilac

Before proceeding, consider if you want your device background image to be overridden with a patched version. If not, modify line 75 to contain the following:

```cc
const std::string DWIP_MDWIV = ""; // DeviceWallpaperImageProto.mutable_device_wallpaper_image
```

Run:

```sh
make
```

## Section V - Extract Device Policy

Open a root shell through mush. Run the following commands to copy your device policy to your Downloads folder:

```sh
mkdir -p /home/chronos/user/Downloads/devicesettings
chmod 777 /home/chronos/user/Downloads/devicesettings
cp /var/lib/devicesettings/* /home/chronos/user/Downloads/devicesettings/
```

## Section VI - Modify Device Policy

Copy all the files in `/home/chronos/user/Downloads/devicesettings` to your Linux box. If using Gitpod, just create a new folder called `devicesettings` and drag and drop the files there.

Then, find the file name with the lowest number after `policy` - like `policy.25` or `policy.26` and remember that filename.

Now, run the following commands to patch the policy with Lilac:

```sh
cd devicesettings
../lilac patch policy.X
```

## Section VII - Replace Policy, Set Launch Flags, and Swap Release Channel

Download the files to your downloads folder in a directory called `newdevicesettings` and run the following command in a root shell to configure your Chromebook for the exploit:

```sh
sed -i 's/CHROMEOS_RELEASE_TRACK=stable-channel/CHROMEOS_RELEASE_TRACK=testimage-channel/g' /etc/lsb-release
``

Now, we need to relaunch /opt/google/chrome/chrome with the required launch flag, `--disable-policy-key-verification`. To do so, we'll use a method originally found by TitaniumNetwork, which in effect is a simple bash script to kill and relaunch the process with new command-line flags.

First, find your command-line arguments on `chrome://version`. Copy the entire string, as missing flags could cause bugs. Then, create a new file and edit it with `vi`, like this:

```sh
cd ~
touch relaunch_with_flags.sh
vi relaunch_with_flags.sh
```

Inside of vim, add the following content (press `i` before typing anything to enter insert mode):

```txt
pkill -9 chrome
```

Create a new line and paste the entire string you got from `chrome://version`, but with `--disable-policy-key-verification` added to the end. Press `Esc`, then type `wq` and press `Enter`. Vi should exit and you should be good to run the script:

```
bash relaunch_with_flags.sh
```

Sign back in and you'll be good to move on to the next step.

## Section VIII - Overwrite Policies On-Device

Download the policies (and the `owner.key` file) into a new folder in your Downloads directory named `newdevicesettings` and run the following command in a root shell:

```sh
cp /home/chronos/user/Downloads/newdevicesettings/* /var/lib/devicesettings
```

## Section IX - Revert Changes

When you're done enjoying modified device policies, you can revert the changes by:

- Running the following command:

```sh
sed -i 's/CHROMEOS_RELEASE_TRACK=testimage-channel/CHROMEOS_RELEASE_TRACK=stable-channel/g' /etc/lsb-release
```

- Copying the original policy files back to their original location
- Restarting your device
