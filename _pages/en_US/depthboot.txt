## Preliminary Information

Depthboot is a modification to a stock Linux distro that replaces the pre-existing kernel with that of ChromiumOS, providing near-perfect compatibility with hardware (including audio).

## Section I - Build Depthboot

You can skip this step if you already built Depthboot.

Follow the instructions [here](https://eupnea-linux.github.io/docs/depthboot/requirements) to build Depthboot for your Chromebook. Make sure to input your board codename and not your `stable-channel` value into the automatic device finder. Make sure to skip step 5 and 6 of the build instructions, those will be covered here.

## Section II - Boot into Depthboot

You can also skip this step if you already booted into Depthboot.

Open mush (murkmod only) and select option 15 (Enable dev_boot_usb). Reboot your device with the USB drive plugged in and press `Ctrl+U` at the developer mode warning screen.

## Section III - Install to Disk

Open a terminal and run the following commands, answering prompts (if appliccable):

```sh
setup-audio
install-to-internal
```

You'll now have Depthboot installed to your disk. Upon rebooting, you'll boot into Depthboot instead of ChromeOS.

## Section IV - Reverting

When you want to revert back to ChromeOS, you'll need to flash a recovery drive with the latest version for your `stable_channel` and recover your device as normal (`Esc+Refresh+Power`, plug in your recovery drive, and wait for 10 minutes).
